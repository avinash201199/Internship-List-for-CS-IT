<br>
About <br>

 Fresh Prints is an NYC-based custom apparel startup. We ﬁnd incredible students and give them the working capital, training, and support to build the business at their schools. We have 400+ students who will contribute significantly to our revenue in the next 12 months. We develop, host, and operate a custom-built OMS and a client-facing application. 

What new unique value propositions can we create through tech? How do we develop additional revenue channels? Increase operational efficiency? How do we usher in the next stage at Fresh Prints? 

Those are the questions the members of our cross-functional Growth Team work on every day. They do so not as developers, designers, or marketers, but as entrepreneurs, determined to drive the business forward. 

You’ll touch every component of the product development process. You’ll work with our developers, UX/UI designers, and QA team to understand users, scope out new tech, prioritize features, set timelines, and write great code. 

This is a hands on internship and we expect you to learn to work at the same level as our full time developers. It’s perfect for students who want to do real work. As Fresh Prints grows, you will too. For the right person, this role offers an uncapped opportunity. Great interns will be offered full time positions at the end of their term. 

#### Responsibilities:

- Engage in high-level conversations about business strategy and the role tech plays in it 
- Write well-designed, testable, and efficient code that powers our application 
- Write specs and do planning for everything we build 
- Conduct application analysis, testing, and debugging 
- Diligently document code to keep it clean and transparent 
- Ensure cross-browser and device compatibility <br>

<br>Education and Experience Required:<br>
- Currently a student and on track to graduate in the spring of 2023 
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
- Comfort with Angular and NodeJS is a big plus 
- Have studied object-oriented and functional programming
