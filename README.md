<summary> Amazon- Software Development Engineer Intern </summary>
<br>
About <br>
At Amazon, we hire the best minds in technology to innovate and build on behalf of our customers. The intense focus we have on our customers is why we are one of the worldâ€™s most beloved brands â€“ customer obsession is part of our company DNA. Our interns write real software and collaborate with a select group of experienced software development engineers (SDEs) who guide interns on projects that matter to our customers.<br>

As an intern, you will be matched to a manager and a mentor. You will have the opportunity to influence the evolution of Amazon technology and lead mission critical projects early in your career. Your design, code, and raw smarts will contribute to solving some of the most complex technical challenges in the areas of distributed systems, data mining, automation, optimization, scalability, and security â€“ just to name a few.<br>

In addition to working on an impactful project, you will have the opportunity to engage with Amazonians for both personal and professional development, expand your network, and participate in activities with other interns throughout your internship. No matter the location of your internship, we give you the tools to own your project and learn in a real-world setting. Many of our technologies overlap, and you would be hard pressed to find a team that is not using Amazon Web Services (AWS), touching the catalogue, or iterating services to better personalize for customers.<br>

If this opportunity interests you, apply and come chart your own path at Amazon.<br>

By applying to this position your application will be considered for all locations we hire for in India. This includes but is not limited to Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi and Pune.<br>

    #### Steps to apply for Internship <br>
    
            Solve 3 challenges <br>
            Visit https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/hackerrank-internship-challenges/challenges and solve all three
            challenges in that page. There is no time limit to solve these challenges. These challenges are not your
            standard DSA questions, but simple coding questions. All we want to check is whether you can translate from
            English to (C/C++/Python or Java....). This round is not intended to understand your dynamic programming or
            BFS/DFS skills. But we need to ensure you can code simple programming challenges before we consider you for
            the next round. Please make sure you mention your HackerRank profile (with which you solved the three
            questions) in your resume. <br>

            Create a resume.
            Go to  hackerresume.com and create a resume there. ONLY the
            resumes created at HackerResume will be
            considered for the internship.
            Why do we ask for resume in this format? Your resume is actually reviewed by Hari, the CTO of HackerRank. He
            accepts of having "well designed resume bias". Everyone (including Hari) likes a good resume. But in an
            ideal world, only your work/skill in the resume should matter. Design of the resume should not decide
            whether you are selected to the next round or not. To avoid this bias completely, we are trying to get all
            the resume in a single, simple & same format.
            Also, we've picked one of the best resume template out there to create a resume for you. We've also followed
            some of the best practices from the book https://thetechresume.com/ so that you don't have to do all the
            hard work. We hope even if things don't end well with HackerRank internship, this resume is helpful to you.
