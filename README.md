**Steps to apply for Internship**

<h2>Solve 3 challenges</h2>
Visit https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/hackerrank-internship-challenges/challenges and solve all three challenges in that page. There is no time limit to solve these challenges. These challenges are not your standard DSA questions, but simple coding questions. All we want to check is whether you can translate from English to (C/C++/Python or Java....). This round is not intended to understand your dynamic programming or BFS/DFS skills. But we need to ensure you can code simple programming challenges before we consider you for the next round. Please make sure you mention your HackerRank profile (with which you solved the three questions) in your resume.<br>

<h2>Create a resume.</h2>
Go to hackerresume.com and create a resume there. ONLY the resumes created at HackerResume will be considered for the internship.
Why do we ask for resume in this format? Your resume is actually reviewed by Hari, the CTO of HackerRank. He accepts of having "well designed resume bias". Everyone (including Hari) likes a good resume. But in an ideal world, only your work/skill in the resume should matter. Design of the resume should not decide whether you are selected to the next round or not. To avoid this bias completely, we are trying to get all the resume in a single, simple & same format. 
Also, we've picked one of the best resume template out there to create a resume for you. We've also followed some of the best practices from the book https://thetechresume.com/ so that you don't have to do all the hard work. We hope even if things don't end well with HackerRank internship, this resume is helpful to you.<br>

<h2>Upload your resume</h2>
Come back to this page, scroll down and Apply to the job below only with your HackerResume.<br>
DON'T USE THE APPLY VIA LINKEDIN OPTION.<br>
If you have any questions about the above mentioned steps, write into internship-queries@hackerrank.com and someone from our team will answer it.
